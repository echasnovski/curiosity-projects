# Curiosity projects

Common feature of these projects is that they all started because I was curious about something: answer to a question, new technology, etc.

Every directory should be considered as separate "project".

Currently, these are created:

- **ttd-world-record**: exploration of world record by Dan Ives (founder of TableTennisDaily brand) for "longest duration to control a table tennis ball with a bat".
